It’s an approach to [paying off your credit cards](https://www.upgrade.com/credit-health/insights/pay-off-credit-card-debt/). If you use a loan to consolidate your credit cards, you’ll make a single monthly payment instead of one for each credit card. You’ll also have a date when you’ll be debt free - for example, if you get a loan with a 36 month term, you’ll know that your credit card debt will be paid off in 36 months. Lastly, personal loans through Upgrade have fixed interest rates. This means your interest rate will never go up, you can easily predict how much you’ll pay each month, and you may save on interest over time!"
              },
              {
                "question": "How does Debt Payoff work?",
                "answer": "The Debt Payoff option may appear when you check your rate with Upgrade. It allows you to use all or part of your loan to pay off existing debt. If you’re approved for a personal loan and select this option, you’ll tell Upgrade which credit card debts or personal loans you’d like us to pay and how much of your new loan you’d like to put towards this debt. Upgrade will coordinate sending the funds from your new personal loan to your previous creditors."

              {
                "question": "What's the difference between refinancing credit card debt with a personal loan and a balance transfer?",
                "answer": "A balance transfer happens when you move debt from one account to another. This can help you lower your interest rate, but it has a few downsides. For one, you’ll typically be charged a balance transfer fee between 3-5% of the amount transferred. You may also have a low balance transfer card limit, which will keep you from transferring your full balance. Additionally, you won’t be able to transfer a balance from the same issuer. And since you’re transferring one credit card balance to another, you may still deal with variable interest rates that can cost you more money over time.\n\nOn the other hand, a personal loan gives you a fixed interest rate and a set date when you’ll have paid off your debt. \n\nLearn more about [revolving debt (credit cards) vs. installment debt (personal loans).](https://www.upgrade.com/credit-health/insights/revolving-debt-vs-installment-debt/)"

              {
                "question": "How will refinancing my credit cards affect my credit score?",
                "answer": "Refinancing credit card debt with a personal loan increases your available credit. If the amount of credit you're using stays consistent and your available credit increases, [your credit utilization ratio will be lower](https://www.upgrade.com/credit-health/insights/credit-utilization-ratio/). This can help increase your credit score.\n\nAdditionally, if you make payments on your new personal loan on time, you’ll improve your payment history. Payment history is the biggest factor behind your credit score."

          "legal": "\\* Personal loans made through Upgrade feature Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) of 9.99%-35.99%. All personal loans have a 1.85% to 9.99% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds. Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existing debt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months. For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month term and a 17.59% APR (which includes a 13.94% yearly interest rate and a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 in your account and would have a required monthly payment of $341.48. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total $12,293.46. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and your loan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actual rate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term, and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and fees may increase the cost of your fixed rate loan. There is no fee or penalty for repaying a loan early.\n\n\\*\\* To qualify for the welcome bonus, you must add a Rewards Checking Plus account through Upgrade to your loan application, receive the loan, open the Rewards Checking Plus account, and direct deposit at least $1,000 to your Rewards Checking Plus account within 45 days of the date the Rewards Checking Plus account is opened. If you have previously opened a checking account through Upgrade or do not open a Rewards Checking Plus account as part of this application process, you are not eligible for this welcome bonus offer. Your Rewards Checking Plus account must be open and in good standing and you must be current on all loan(s) through Upgrade (including, for avoidance of doubt, any auto refinance loan(s)) to receive a bonus. Joint loan applications do not qualify for the welcome bonus. Welcome bonus offers cannot be combined, substituted, or applied retroactively. The bonus will be applied to your Rewards Checking Plus account as a one-time payout within 60 days of meeting the conditions. Approval of your loan is not guaranteed and is subject to our verification and review process.\n\n† Accept your loan offer and your funds will be sent to your bank or designated account within one (1) business day of clearing necessary verifications. Availability of the funds is dependent on how quickly your bank processes the transaction. From the time of approval, funds sent directly to you should be available within one (1) business day. Funds sent directly to pay off your creditors may take up to 2 weeks to clear, depending on the creditor.\n\nApple, Apple Pay®, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the US and other countries.
